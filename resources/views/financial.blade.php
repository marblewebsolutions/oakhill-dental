            <h2 class="subtitle">FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS</h2>
            <p>Our goal is to help you understand your treatment options and the
            associated fees so you can best choose a course of action that is 
            best for you before you incur fees. Following a thorough 
            examination, we establish a personalized treatment plan.</p>
            
            <h2 class="subtitle">INSURANCE CONSIDERATIONS</h2>
            <p>In addition we will work with you on an individual basis to 
            maximize your insurance reimbursements, your budget and timeframe. 
            Our practice is not an insurance driven practice which means we are 
            here to help you choose dental treatments that benefit you, not to 
            be driven by Insurance limitations. We will help you to understand 
            what you can expect from your insurance reimbursement. We cannot 
            guarantee what your insurance company will pay for each individual 
            claim. As a service to our patients we will bill all insurance 
            companies for services and allow them 45 days to render payment. 
            After 60 days the patient is responsible for payment.</p>
            
            <h2 class="subtitle">CASH OR CHECK</h2>
            <p>If you pay in full before treatment begins, we will give you a 
            5% pre-payment fee reduction, or for your convenience half of the 
            treatment fee can be divided between the first and last visits.</p>
            
            <h2 class="subtitle">CREDIT CARDS</h2>
            <p>We accept Visa, Mastercard, and CareCredit.</p>
            
            <h2 class="subtitle">LOW MONTHLY PAYMENT PLANS</h2>
            <p>We work with a financial partner, Care Credit. There are no up
