    missing teeth and help restore your smile. If you’ve lost all or some of your 
    natural teeth, whether from gum disease, tooth decay or injury, replacing 
    missing teeth will benefit your appearance and your health. That’s because 
    dentures make it easier to eat and speak better than you could without 
    teeth—things that people often take for granted.<br><br>
    Many people have regained comfort and confidence by replacing missing teeth with 
    All-on-4 denture with dental implants. This treatment has become popular and

    dental implants, it’s possible to replace all of your teeth in just one day. And 
    since the treatment costs less than other options, many more people are able to
