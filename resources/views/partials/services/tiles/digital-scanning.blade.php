    We are so excited to announce to you the arrival of our newest addition to 
    our practice...the iTero Element 2 digital scanner! This is a state of the 
    art 3D digital scanning system that captures digital impressions of teeth 
    and oral tissues! The data that is generated from the iTero will be used for 
    making dental restorations, Orthodontic devices, and other dental 
    accessories.<br><br>
    Which means it will almost eliminate the use of messy dental impression 
    material for crowns, bridge work, Orthodontics, etc. This in turn will make 
    those appointments more comfortable and much more efficient for our patients! 
    We strive to provide our patients the ultimate service by keeping our office 
    equipped with the best technology!'])
