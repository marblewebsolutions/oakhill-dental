    'service_info_text' => 'An extraction means to have a tooth removed, usually 
    because of disease, trauma or crowding. If you need an extraction, we will 
    first numb the area to lessen any discomfort. We offer nitrous oxide to help 
    ease your apprehension. After the extraction, we will advise you of what post 
    extraction regimen to follow. In most cases a small amount of bleeding is 
    normal. Your mouth will slowly fill in the bone where the tooth root was 
    through the formation of a blood clot. We will help you determine the best 
    option for replacing the missing tooth. Option would include a bridge, implant 
    or a partial denture.'])
