    <span class="bold">Why Choose Invisalign Over Traditional Options?</span><br>
    
    Traditional braces are made out of metal, can be extremely uncomfortable, and 
    are not removable without a dental professional’s help. In addition, they can 
    come out of alignment and cause discomfort and damage to your mouth, requiring 
    you to visit the dentist to fix it. This can be a huge inconvenience to you and 
    take extensive time and effort. Furthermore, metal braces are very noticeable 
    and the only way to hide them is to not smile. You should never have to hide 
    your smile simply due to embarrassment, as we consider a person’s natural smile 
    to be one of the most valuable things they can have.<br>
    
    Invisalign, on the other hand, is a completely clear plastic aligner specifically 
    molded to fit comfortably over your teeth. Over time, your teeth will move into 
    the aligner’s correct position and shift gradually, week by week, until all your 
    teeth are properly in place. These transparent aligners are worn for about two 
    weeks each and can be removed to floss, brush, drink, and eat. The total treatment 
    time is approximately just 6-15 months. These Invisalign “braces” are so comfortable 
    and clear that you can wear them throughout your day without anyone even noticing!.<br><br>
