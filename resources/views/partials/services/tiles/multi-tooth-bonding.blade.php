    are bonded to the tooth. Bonding is typically used for cosmetic purposes to 
    improve the appearance of a discolored or chipped tooth. It is also used to 
    close spaces between teeth, to make teeth look longer or to change the shape 
    or color of teeth. Often times bonding is used as a cosmetic alternative to 
    amalgam fillings, or to protect a portion of the toothâ€™s root that has been 
    exposed when gums recede.'])
