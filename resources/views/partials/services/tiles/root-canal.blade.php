    a tooth that is badly decayed or becomes infected. Although root canals 
    have a bad reputation, I like to refer to them as simply a root filling. 
    During a root canal procedure, the nerve and pulp are removed and the inside 
    of the tooth is cleaned and sealed. We offer nitrous oxide to help ease your apprehension."])
