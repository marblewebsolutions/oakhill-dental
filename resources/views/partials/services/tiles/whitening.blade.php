    'service_info_text' => 'Philips Zoom WhiteSpeed is clinically proven to whiten 
    teeth up to 8 shades in 45 minutes. Thatâ€™s 40% better than comparable non-light 
    activated systems. The new LED light technology emits at the optimal light spectrum 
    with 100% greater light intensity than the closest competitive lamp. We also 
    provide bleach for life for our patients. We will give our patients free refills 
    of bleach if they come in every 6 months to get their teeth cleaned and your 
    accounts are up to date. We often offer a $50 rebate for zoom services.<br><br>
    <b>Tray Whitening:</b> A dental hygienist or assistant will take a mold of your 
    teeth to make your own custom, take home mouth trays. These trays are then worn 
    at night OR for a brief time during the day, depending on what kind of gel in 
    the dentist recommends for the tray.'])
